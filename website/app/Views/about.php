                <p>Team Goal:
                Our "Uncovering Dark Patterns" project aims to develop a real-time tool that enables users to identify and understand dark design practices adopted by organizations. This can protect users' interests and well-being. Our project will design a web extension tool to address this situation, which enables users to make informed decisions through techniques that recognize the grayscale of web pages and highlight instances of dark design without altering copyrighted content. This initiative aims to equip users with the knowledge and tools to identify manipulative design practices, make informed choices, and promote ethical and transparent user experiences.

                <h2>About Our Project</h2>
                <h3>Project Overview </h3>
                <P>our "Unmasking Dark Patterns" project is of paramount importance as it seeks to develop a real-time tool capable of empowering users to recognize and comprehend the dark design practices employed by organizations. The project's core mission is to safeguard user interests and well-being. We envision the creation of a web browser extension tool that equips users with the ability to make informed decisions. This is achieved by identifying grayscale elements within webpages and prominently highlighting instances of dark design practices, all without altering copyrighted content. The multifaceted objectives of this project encompass several critical dimensions.
